 When submitting a change for review, you will usually want it to be based on the tip of upstream branch in order to avoid possible conflicts. When amending a change and rebasing the new patchset, the Gerrit web interface will show a difference between the two patchsets which contains all commits in between. This may confuse many reviewers that would expect to see a much simpler difference.
